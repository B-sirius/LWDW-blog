Sign in with Apple is commonly used by modern apps now, this article will introduce a way to implement it with Flutter for iOS apps.

## Intro

Here I will introduce the Apple login flow in iOS, which is **based on the authorization code.**

There should be another way to use the identity token and Apple public key to do the same job, but we didn’t put it into practice, so for now I won’t cover it.

### Flow

The iOS apple login flow is not bounded with flutter tech (Apple login in Android or Web has more steps than this and is not introduced here).

### Used Packages

- Flutter
  - [sign_in_with_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple). Flutter bridge to Sign in with Apple.
- Node
  - [apple-signin-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apple-signin-auth). Apple sign in for Node.js.

### Docs

- [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/generate_and_validate_tokens )

## Steps

### 1. Settings on the Apple Developer page

**A paid apple developer membership account is required for this step!**

In this step, we need to setup two things:

- an identifier that configures the App capabilities.
- create a private key.

#### edit/create Identifier

Visit [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list). Choose “[Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)“ and create/edit the APP’s identifier. Make sure “Sign in with Apple“ is selected in Capabilities.

After the identifier is created, it will show **team ID** and **bundle ID**.

we can also find team ID on [account page](https://developer.apple.com/account).

#### create private key

Choose “[keys](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list)“ and register a new key, also make sure “Sign in with Apple“ is selected.

Then select the Primary app ID as the identifier bundle ID we just edited/selected.

After it’s registered, it will provide a **one-time** download link to download the **private key** file.

Also, it has a **key ID**.

### 2. Settings in Xcode

Open App project, Select “Target-Runner-Signing & Capabilities“ and add “Sign in with Apple“ Capability.

Open “Signing“ tab and select the developer team ID and bundle ID.

### 3. Logic in the Client side

We are using flutter to build our App, and the package [sign_in_with_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple) will help integrate with Apple service to get the credential we need. It’s usage is very straightforward so just check the [example](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple#example-usage). And in the end, you will get a credential that contains the authorization code. It will be the key parameter for our App login API.

### 4. Logic in the App Service side

The APP service will handle most part of the work. We are using node.js and the package [apple-signin-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apple-signin-auth).

In this step, we only focus on two parts:

- create client secret
- get authorization token

#### create client secret

Before we can ask Apple service for an authorization token, we need a “client secret“, which is a JWT used for each validation request between our server and apple service. if we check the [doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/generate_and_validate_tokens#3262048) for details, we will see Apple requests the JWT be signed with a specific algorithm. So the [apple-signin-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apple-signin-auth) do us a favor, just use appleSignin.getClientSecret with the right parameters:

```javascript
const clientSecret = appleSignin.getClientSecret({
  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID, AKA Bundle ID
  teamID: 'teamID', // Apple Developer Team ID.
  privateKey: 'PRIVATE_KEY_STRING', // private key associated with your client ID. -- Or provide a `privateKeyPath` property instead.
  keyIdentifier: 'XXXXXXXXXX', // identifier of the private key. AKA key ID. - can be found here https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list
  // OPTIONAL
  expAfter: 15777000, // Duration after which to expire JWT
});
```

### get authorization token

This part is straightforward. Just call the API and Apple service will return the authorization token. We can check the [doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/generate_and_validate_tokens#url) and as always, [apple-signin-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apple-signin-auth) wrapped it as a function to call:

```javascript
const options = {
  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID, AKA Bundle ID
  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/apple/callback', // We don't need it in our login flow.
  clientSecret: clientSecret
};

try {
  const tokenResponse = await appleSignin.getAuthorizationToken(code, options);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

Once our App Service gets the authorization token, we can do our business logic, like getting the user info, which shouldn’t be a problem.

## Conclusion

So this is the way to support Apple login **based on the authorization code in** **iOS**. Just remember there are other ways and more to set up if you want to support Android or Web.
